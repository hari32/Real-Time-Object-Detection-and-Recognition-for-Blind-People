# Real-Time-Object-Detection-and-Recognition-for-Blind-People
 Is to create an intelligent system, imitating the human eye, which transfers different scenes and images to the brain. The brain in turn analyzes the images or scenes, and based on previously stored information, the surrounding objects are identified. For this purpose, we use a small device that performs similar to the human brain, called "Raspberry Pi"; it is a small device that analyzes the images and scenes with the help of the camera, which moves the images to the small device. Then, the process of analysis begins through long complex algorithms known as the neural network algorithms. This network analyzes the images to parts in order to compare them with the most important characteristics of the objects in the images related to the database, through which the images are compared. When ensuring that the characteristics match the mathematical equations programmed in the language of the Python, the objects in the image are detected. Finally, the sound of each tool in the database is called, and a message is sent to tell the blind about the tools in front of him/ her
